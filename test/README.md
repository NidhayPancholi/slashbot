# Test suite

Test suite for MyDollarBot. For phase 1 of Project 2, we are focusing on getting any/all tests created.
The repo given had 1 test case and 0% test coverage. This README explores what methods we can test
and how they integrate with other methods.

The test base being used by this github repo is managed in a shared account that all team members have access to. This was done by:

1. Creating a gmail account, mydollarbot@gmail.com that all group members have access to
2. Creating a free phone number using the gmail account
3. Creating a telegram using the free phone number, and generating a API_TOKEN
4. The API_TOKEN therefore can be shared across all members
