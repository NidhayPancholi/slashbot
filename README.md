# :rocket: Installation Guide

## ðŸ’»For developers 
1. Install Python, atleast Python3

2. Clone this repository to your local system at a suitable directory/location of your choice

3. Start a terminal session, and navigate to the directory where the repo has been cloned

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Download and install the Telegram desktop application for your system from the following site: https://desktop.telegram.org/

6. Once you login to your Telegram account, search for "BotFather" in Telegram. Click on "Start" --> enter the following command:
```
  /newbot
```
7. Follow the instructions on screen and choose a name for your bot. Post this, select a username for your bot that ends with "bot" (as per the instructions on your Telegram screen)

8. BotFather will now confirm the creation of your bot and provide a TOKEN to access the HTTP API - copy this token for future use.

9. Search for "Edit the system environment variables" on your local computer. Click on Environment Variables and create a new System Variable called "API_TOKEN" and paste the token copied in step 8.

10. In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering the username and open the same. Once this is done, go back to the terminal session. 
Make sure you export the PYTHONPATH variable to the main project folder
 ```
 python src/bot.py
```
11. A successful run will generate a message on your terminal that says "TeleBot: Started polling." 
12. Post this, navigate to your bot on Telegram, enter the "/start" or "/menu" command, and you are all set to track your expenses!

## ðŸ’»For testing with Pytest
1. Some modules in testing require CHAT_ID environment variable to be set.
2. This is the specific ID that is maintained for your chat with the Bot.
3. While running the bot.py , get this id from line 72 and set it in your system environment variables.
4. This should ensure effective running of all tests.
